As computer networks have grown in scale and complexity, it has become increasingly difficult to monitor them. This lack of awareness makes responding, or even recognizing, attacks a challenge. As a result, organizations’ reactions to attacks are delayed, typically leaving them to address the situation after the fact. This proposal suggests the development and evaluation of adaptive techniques for detecting and responding to network attacks. The core idea behind this work will be to create mechanisms for network defense which are more flexible, easily deployable, and capable of integrating decoy content which may be used as an active indicator of potential network reconnaissance. By detecting potential attacks during their earliest stages, this proposed technology will allow network administrators to respond in a more timely, effective, and economical fashion.

As computer networks have grown in scale and complexity, it has become increasingly difficult to monitor them. This lack of awareness makes responding, or even recognizing, attacks a challenge. As a result, organizations’ reactions to attacks are delayed, typically leaving them to address the situation after the fact. According to the fact of the lack of awareness, it leads us to get the core idea of this work. We decide to use the vulnerable points as a decoy for letting an attacker attacks our computer networks. By detecting potential attacks, we can catch the adversary on the red hand. The attacks from the adversary will be failed by themselves because of the target server does not run the vulnerable services as the information, which is bogus information, that the adversary got. Why we need to use a decoy? Because we need to not only block the attacks but also catch and get the information from an attacker. Mostly, the first step of attacking is port-scanning to get know the vulnerable point on the target. If the target does not have a vulnerable service, the attacker just stop and changes the target.
