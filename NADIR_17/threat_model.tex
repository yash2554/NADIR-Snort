\section{Threat model}
\label{threat_model}

In our research, we assume that all conditions of attack are based on remote attacks. It means â€œno adversaries can get into a target server physically, but they can exploit the target server remotely. The attackers know nothing about the N.A.D.I.R. system so that they attack the target server with no suspect. The attackers use some tools for scanning the target server's running services to learn the information of those services and look for a vulnerable service(s). Once they know the vulnerable service(s) on the target server, they can use other tools to attack the target through that service(s) to down the service or to gain an access so they can do more business. Which this threat model, the N.A.D.I.R. system takes an action at the first place where the attackers scan the running services on the server. The N.A.D.I.R. system hides the true information of running services then sends the decoy services' information back to the attackers. Thus, we can detect and catch the attackers who attack the decoy services.
